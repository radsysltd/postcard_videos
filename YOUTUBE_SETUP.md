## Important Notes

### File Security
- Keep `client_secrets.json` secure and don't share it
- Add `client_secrets.json` and `youtube_token.pickle` to your `.gitignore` file
- The `youtube_token.pickle` file stores your authentication and will be created automatically

### Privacy Settings
- **Unlisted**: Videos are not publicly searchable but can be viewed with the link
- **Private**: Only you can view the videos
- **Public**: Videos are publicly visible and searchable

### Upload Limits
- YouTube has daily upload quotas
- Large files may take time to upload
- The app uploads videos one at a time with progress tracking

### Playlist Management
- **Channel-specific playlists**: Only playlists for the selected channel are shown
- **Auto-create new playlists**: Type a new playlist name and it will be created automatically
- **Existing playlists**: Select from dropdown of playlists that already exist for the channel
- Use "Refresh Playlists" to update the dropdown after creating playlists elsewhere
- The status label shows which channel's playlists are currently displayed
- New playlists are created as "Unlisted" by default
- Videos will be added to the selected/created playlist automatically

### Multi-Channel Support
- If you manage multiple YouTube channels, all will be shown in the Channel dropdown
- Channels are displayed with their name and custom URL (if available)
- Select your preferred channel from the dropdown before uploading
- Use "Set as Default" to save your preferred channel - it will be marked with [DEFAULT]
- Your default channel will be automatically selected when you authenticate
- Each channel has its own playlists and upload settings

## Troubleshooting

### "YouTube API libraries not available"
Run: `pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client`

### "client_secrets.json file not found"
Make sure the credentials file is named exactly `client_secrets.json` and is in the same folder as the main Python file.

### Authentication fails
1. Check that the OAuth consent screen is properly configured
2. Make sure your email is added to test users if the app is in testing mode
3. Try deleting `youtube_token.pickle` and re-authenticating

### Upload fails
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the video file is not corrupted
3. Check YouTube's supported file formats and size limits
4. Ensure you haven't exceeded daily quotas

## File Format Support

The YouTube uploader supports common video formats:
- MP4 (recommended)
- AVI
- MOV
- MKV
- WMV

For best results, use MP4 format which is what the Postcard Video Creator generates.
